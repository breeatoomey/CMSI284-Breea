SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

Your 'findGCD.nasm' program had a couple of errors which I fixed for you so
that it would assemble.  It works mostly now, but doesn't return an output.
Still, very good that you got this much going!

Your 'gcdFinder.c' program needs some work.  The "C" part is fine, but the
nasm part needs to change more from the original file.  It should take the
two numbers as arguments which are going to be on the stack for Win32, or
in the rsi and rdi registers for mac, and not do the same as before when you
ask the user.  That's why you need a different source file for that.

Your paritygen doesn't output anything.

'whichEndIsUp' works perfectly.  Nice job!

Your makeNBO.nasm and makeNBO.c look fine but when it runs it gets a seg
faul.  The standalone makeNBO.c as a test works just fine on both windows
and mac.  The seg fault is from the nasm program that calls the "C" function
You'll need to use the debugger to find out where that happens and fix it if
you want a running program.

All-in-all, nice work on this difficult assignment!  I see you did some
research into some commands we didn't cover in class, too..... GREAT!!!

========================================================
SEMESTER HOMEWORK TOTALS:

   homework01 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework03 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework04 ~  90.00% of  5 points =  4.50 points
   homework05 ~ 100.00% of 10 points = 10.00 points
   homework06 ~  94.00% of 15 points = 14.10 points
                       semester total: 43.60 out of 45.00 = 96.89%
                             which is also a solid A, borderline A-plus

Great work!

Very good work overall.... this is hard stuff and you have worked diligently
for the entire semester.  I look forward to seeing you in future courses ~
have a great holiday!
